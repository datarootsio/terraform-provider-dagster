## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Deployment name

### Optional

- `force_destroy` (Boolean) When `false`, will check if there are code locations associated with the deployment, if there are, it will block the delete of the deployment. When `true` ignore the code locations check. This is done because when you delete a deployment, you delete all the resources/metadata of that deployment and this is not recoverable. DEFAULT `false`
- `settings_document` (String) Deployment settings as a JSON document. We recommend using a `dagster_configuration_document` to generate this instead of composing a JSON document yourself. Leaving this attribute empty or partially filled in, will result in Dagster (partially) applying default settings to your deployment. This leads to perpetual changes in this resource.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) Deployment id
- `status` (String) Deployment status (`ACTIVE` or `PENDNG_DELETION`)
- `type` (String) Deployment type (`PRODUCTION`, `DEV` or `BRANCH`)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Dagster Deployments can be imported via name
terraform import dagster_deployment.this "test-deployment"
```
